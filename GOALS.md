TECH GOALS:

GOALS:
1) fortress close by to 0,0 CHECK (gotchas: people might prefer to know the quadrant ahead of time...)
2) temple near 0,0 CHECK (gotchas: biomes not done and might be a P.I.T.A. sister seeds for correct region to be desert, I might want to allow close in multiple regions so I have more chance of finding a biome fit...)
3) lava pool near 0,0
4) village near 0,0
5) closest stronghold is ocean
6) if village is not savannah then dark oak forest biome near 0,0

Folks might benefit from seeing me dive into actual minecraft java code to see how to learn this stuff.

Make a real thing, in real time, nothing off-screen

Be authentic and show the warts

So that you know what it really feels like to make something tangible

Without the illusion and glamour of easy to digest content
